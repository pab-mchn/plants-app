    "lighting": " Luminous place, with indirect light. It tolerates semi-shade (medium indirect light), but it will grow more slowly and its leaves will be smaller. Avoid direct sun if you do not want to burn its leaves.",
    "irrigation": "Moderate, without waterlogging the substrate!Allow the top half of the substrate to dry between waterings. Remove any excess water left in the potting tray.",
    "temperature": "Make sure the temperature does not drop below 10-15 degrees, you know, they are monsters ;)",
    "humidity": "It likes humidity! It is an all-rounder and adapts to any environment, but if you spray it during the hot season or if you turn on the heating, it will thank you for it, growing lush and leafy. If you wipe the leaves from time to time with a damp cloth you will help it to photosynthesize."

    "lighting": "It must be protected from direct sunlight although it can withstand the first and last rays of sunlight of the day. However, it is necessary to be careful if our monstera has a lot of white part, because it will be more delicate to the sun. Even so, if we offer it the first or last rays we will favor the variegation.",
    "irrigation": "Let the substrate dry out between waterings. We can check it by introducing a wooden stick carefully, if it comes out dry, it needs watering. We will know that it needs watering because its leaves will be less smooth and a little droopy. Its leaves can turn yellow if there is an excess of watering",
    "temperature": "The most important thing about this plant is its low resistance to cold, always having to have a temperature above 5 degrees to survive. For that reason its ideal location is in the interior of our house. If we live in climates with mild winters or we have an enclosed terrace where the temperature does not drop much we can plant it without problems in outdoor areas where there is no direct light from midday, although I do not recommend this with variegatas as they need a more controlled environment.",
    "humidity": "It needs high humidity, which can be achieved by spraying or placing a humidifier more or less near it. If it has a low humidity it will have brown and brittle leaves, and the white part will die sooner. Remember that it is a piece without chlorophyll, therefore much more delicate."

    "lighting": "Indirect light is very important. Look for a well-lit place to take full advantage of its leaves.",
    "irrigation": "It prefers the soil to be kept slightly moist. They are very expressive, so you will notice that as soon as it lacks water it becomes limp. In summer water 2 or 3 times a week and in winter, 1 or 2, especially if there is heating. It does not like very cold water ('cold feet'). Tip: let the water stand in the room for a few hours to allow it to reach room temperature.",
    "temperature": "Between 15 and 25 degrees. It does not tolerate cold or frost, so try not to subject it to temperatures below 15 degrees. It also does not like drafts.",
    "humidity": "Humidity is very important for it. If you live in a dry environment, there is heating or air conditioning, it is advisable to spray its leaves often. One solution is to place them near a humidifier or place a plate at the base of the pot with balls of clay or volcanic clay and water - without touching the pot - to increase the humidity. Another trick is to place several plants together, they cooperate with each other, form their own ecosystem and share the humidity they generate."

    "lighting": "Philodendron Micans likes to receive plenty of indirect light. Direct sun can burn its leaves. It is best to make sure that, if placed in a window, it does not receive direct sunlight on its leaves. Therefore, if your window is facing south, it may be advisable to place a translucent curtain or place your Philodendron in an area further away from direct light.Outdoor cultivation will be done in semi-shade, in a place where it can be protected from the sun's rays. Philodendron Micans can tolerate low light levels, however, its growth will be slower. In addition, its leaves will look smaller and there will be more space between them.",
    "irrigation": "Let the top layers of the substrate dry out before watering again. To check this, you can stick your finger into the substrate, and if it is dry, then it is time to water. It is important not to let the soil dry out completely between watering, as this could damage the plant.Water the pot from the top until the water runs out of the drainage holes. In general, watering will always depend on the amount of light your Philodendron receives. You will need to water more in the warmer months and water more frequently in the winter.",
    "temperature": "The ideal temperature for Philodendron Micans is between 18 - 30ºC . It can withstand higher temperatures provided it has sufficient humidity. It does not tolerate frost. Your Micans philodendron will appreciate it if you spray its leaves, especially during the warmer seasons.",
    "humidity": "Because of its tropical origin, Philodendron Micans likes high humidity. You can increase humidity levels around your plant by spraying its leaves with a spray bottle (at least a couple of times a week), placing it over a dish with water and small pebbles, or using a humidifier."
